# odd_elastic_wave
These codes and datasets have been used for the study to generate persistent noise-driven odd elastic waves in overdamped chiral active matter. This study can be found in arXiv: S.H. Choi, Z.-F. Huang, N. Goldenfeld, "Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter", arXiv:2411.09615[cond-mat.soft] (2024) (DOI: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.09615)

**Code description**
toymodel_noise_multirun.c : simulation of the toy model of a spring network with both longitudinal and transverse interactions.

starfish_noise_multirun.c : simulation of the starfish embryo model based on the work
