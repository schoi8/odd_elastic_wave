The experimental data have been collected by the Fakhri group at MIT and led to a published work: T.H. Tan, A. Mietke, J. Li, Y. Chen, H. Higinbotham, P.J. Foster, S. Gokhale, J. Dunkel and N. Fakhri. Odd dynamics of living chiral crystals, _Nature_ **607**, 287 (2022).

We obtained the coordinate values of the starfish embryos (Xmat and Ymat files) and extracted the trajectories of the embryos that are long enough to generate the current correlation functions using the code "expt_data_analysis_traj.ipynb". Then the code "expt_3dFFT.c" was used to generate the Fourier-transformed current correlation functions. For the Fourier transform, we used fftw3. Then the code "expt_analysis_plots.ipynb" was used to analyze the current correlation functions and generate the dispersion relation plots.
