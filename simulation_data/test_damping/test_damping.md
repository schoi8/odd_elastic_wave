Current correlation functions for the toy model and the starfish embryo model in the presence and absence of damping due to longitudinal force. These models do not include noise. 

The data are generated by the code "toymodel_noise_multirun.c" and "starfishmodel_noise_multirun.c" with zero noise strength (D0=0.0 for the toy model, and v0=0.0 and ve=0.0 for the starfish embryo model). The data are analyzed by the code "test_damping.ipynb".

**Parameters used to generate the data**

_toy_damped_k05_ka1_D0: longitudinal spring constant k = 0.5, transverse spring constant ka = 1.0, noise = 0.0

_toy_undamped_k0_ka1_D0: longitudinal spring constant k = 0.0, transverse spring constant ka = 1.0, noise = 0.0

_starfish_damped: longitudinal attractive force Fst0 = 53.7, longitudinal repulsive force frep = 785.1, self-spinning frequency w0 = 1.0, transverse force f0 = 1.0

_starfish_undamped: longitudinal attractive force Fst0 = 0.0, longitudinal repulsive force frep = 0.0, self-spinning frequency w0 = 0.1, transverse force f0 = 0.5

More information on the parameters are recorded in the files "simulation_para_....txt" with "..." labeling the model.
