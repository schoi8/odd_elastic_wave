Here are the current correlation data obtained from simulations of the toy model and the starfish embryo model. 
The toy model is based on the Hookean spring model introduced in C. Scheibner, A. Souslov, D. Banerjee, P. Surowka, W. Irvine and V. Vitelli. Odd elasticity, _Nat. Phys._ **16**, 475 (2020). 
The starfish embryo model is based on the one introduced in T.H. Tan, A. Mietke, J. Li, Y. Chen, H. Higinbotham, P.J. Foster, S. Gokhale, J. Dunkel and N. Fakhri. Odd dynamics of living chiral crystals, _Nature_ **607**, 287 (2022).

**File name convention**

Cll means the longitudinal current correlation function, Ctt means the transverse current correlation function, and Cltr and Clti mean the real and imaginary parts of the cross current correlation function respectively.

_toy means the data were generated from the toy model while _starfish means the data were generated from the starfish embryo model.

**Parameters used to generate the data**

_toy_damped_k05_ka1_D0: longitudinal spring constant k = 0.5, transverse spring constant ka = 1.0, noise = 0.0

_toy_undamped_k0_ka1_D0: longitudinal spring constant k = 0.0, transverse spring constant ka = 1.0, noise = 0.0

_starfish_damped: longitudinal attractive force Fst0 = 53.7, longitudinal repulsive force frep = 785.1, self-spinning frequency w0 = 1.0, transverse force f0 = 1.0

_starfish_undamped: longitudinal attractive force Fst0 = 0.0, longitudinal repulsive force frep = 0.0, self-spinning frequency w0 = 0.1, transverse force f0 = 0.5
