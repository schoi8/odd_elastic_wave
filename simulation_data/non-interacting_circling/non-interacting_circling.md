Current correlation functions from the simulation of non-interacting self-circling particles. The data were generated by the code "non-interacting_selfcircling_multirun.c" and are analyzed by the code "non-interacting_self-circling_analysis.ipynb". The parameters used for the simulation are recorded in the file "simulation_para.txt".

Because of the file size limit of GitHub, I couldn't upload the files, but they are generated quickly by the code "non-interacting_selfcircling_multirun.c", so please use it if you want the datasets.
