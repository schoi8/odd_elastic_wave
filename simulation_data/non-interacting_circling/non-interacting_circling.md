Current correlation functions from the simulation of non-interacting self-circling particles. The data were generated by the code "non-interacting_selfcircling_multirun.c" and are analyzed by the code "non-interacting_self-circling_analysis.ipynb". The parameters used for the simulation are recorded in the file "simulation_para.txt".
