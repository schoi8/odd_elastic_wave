Current correlation functions for the toy model and the starfish embryo models with noise. 

The toy model data were generated by the code "toymodel_noise_multirun.c", and the starfish embryo model data were generated by the code "starfishmodel_noise_multirun.c". 

Both data are analyzed by the code "simulation_band_analysis_plots.ipynb".
