The timeseries data of the self-spinning frequency of the starfish embryos in the absence of self-circling. The actual data created were too large to upload on GitHub, but they are quickly generated by the code "starfishmodel_wupdate_test.c", so please use this code. The parameters used for the simulation are recorded in the file "simulation_para.txt". The generated "w_arr.dat" file is analyzed by the code "starfishmodel_wupdate_test.ipynb".
